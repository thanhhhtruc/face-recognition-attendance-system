# Face Recognition Attendance System

## Project Overview
AI-powered facial recognition attendance system with anti-spoofing and emotion detection using TensorFlow and Next.js. The system integrates three main components:

1. **Face Verification**: Identifies if a person is registered in the database.
2. **Anti-Spoofing Module**: Detects liveness to prevent spoofing using photos or screens.
3. **Emotion Detection Module**: Analyzes and displays the user's emotional state.

## Features
### Frontend
- **Face Registration**: Allows users to register their face.
- **Face Verification**: Verifies registered faces.
- **Emotion Status**: Displays detected emotions.
- **Liveness Indicator**: Ensures the user is present and not spoofing.

### Backend
- **Face Embedding Models**: Implements two approaches for face verification:
  - **Approach A**: Supervised learning using EfficientNetV2S.
  - **Approach B**: Metric learning with Batch-Hard Triplet Loss.
- **Anti-Spoofing**: Detects liveness using MiniFASNet models.
- **Face Detection**: Utilizes RetinaFace for face detection.

## Project Structure
### Frontend
Located in the `facial-recognition-fe` folder:
- **Next.js Application**: Contains pages, components, and UI elements.
- **Components**: Modular React components for various functionalities.
- **Public Assets**: Placeholder images and logos.
- **Styles**: Global CSS for consistent design.

### Backend
Located in the `facial-recognition-be` folder:
- **API**: Python scripts for face verification, anti-spoofing, and emotion detection.
- **Resources**: Pre-trained models for face detection and anti-spoofing.
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for data processing and model training.
